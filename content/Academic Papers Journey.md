## About and Motivation

I have figured that properly doing a research at the Ph.D. level requires reading and digesting lots and lots of academic papers. And considering that there should be a procedure to categorize them and have all the information in one place so it should be reviewed and analyzed later, I decided to create this page and follow the progress.

So, this section will contain the summaries to academic papers which I have read and current status of each one. A general note on the reading/summarizing procedure is as follows:

1. Add the paper to _Zotero_.
2. Phase 1
   - Title, Abstract, Introduction
   - Structure
   - Conclusion
   - _Evaluation_
3. Phase 2
   - Skim
   - Figures
   - Important References
   - _Annotate Key Points_
   - _Short Summary_
4. Phase 3
   - _Read Thoroughly_
   - _Jot Down Ideas_
   - Re-implement
   - Identify Strong and Weak Points/Arguments
   - Identify Implicit Assumptions
