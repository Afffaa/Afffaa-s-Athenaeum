## About and Motivation

I have figured that properly doing a research at the Ph.D. level requires reading and digesting lots and lots of academic papers. And considering that there should be a procedure to categorize them and have all the information in one place so it should be reviewed and analyzed later, I decided to create this page and follow the progress.


# Chronological list of papers read
