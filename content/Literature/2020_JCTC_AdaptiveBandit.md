> [!Abstract] Abstract
>
> - Sampling from the Equilibrium Distribution has always been a major problem in Molecular Simulations due to the very high Dimensionality of the Conformational Space.
> - Over several decades, many approaches have been used to overcome this problem
> - In particular, we focus on Unbiased Simulation Methods such as Parallel and Adaptive Sampling
> - Here, we recast Adaptive Sampling Scgenes on the basis of Multi-armed Bandits and Develop a Novel Adaptive Sampling Algorithm under this Framework, AdaptiveBandit
> - We Test it on multiple Simplified Potentials and in a Protein Folding Scenario
> - We find that this Framework performs similarly to or better than previous Methods in every type of Test Potentials
> - Furthermore, it Provides a Novel Framework to Develop new Sampling Algorithms with better Asymptotic Characteristics
